# What is JSON-stat?

The JSON-stat format is a simple lightweight JSON standard for data dissemination. It is based in a cube model that arises from the evidence that the most common form of data dissemination is the tabular form. In this cube model, **datasets** are organized in **dimensions**. Dimensions are organized in **categories**.

The JSON-stat format is documented at [JSON-stat.org](https://json-stat.org/format/).

# What is the JSON-stat Toolkit?

The JSON-stat Toolkit is a set of tools for the JSON-stat format:

* The goal of the [JSON-stat Javascript Toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonstat) (JJT) is to help dealing with JSON-stat responses in Javascript.
* For a library of high level functions built on top of JJT, see the [JSON-stat Javascript Utilities Suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonstat-utils) (JJUS).
* For simple conversion from the JSON-stat format, see the [JSON-stat Command Line Conversion Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonstat-conv).
* Visit the [JSON-stat Explorer](http://json-stat.com/explorer/) to view JSON-stat responses.
